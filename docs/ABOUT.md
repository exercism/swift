"Swift is an alternative for the Objective-C language that employs contemporary programming language theory concepts and strives to present a simpler syntax. Swift introduces true named parameters and retains key Objective-C concepts, including protocols, closures and categories, often replacing former syntax with cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to other language structures, like enums." -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)
