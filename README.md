## Swift Track

We use Github Actions to automatically run all the unit tests on the code that is going to be checked in. In addition we also have [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) set up to make sure that the code is consistent across all exercises. Please run `swiftlint autocorrect --format` on your code before submitting a PR. Make sure all the tests pass locally using the swift package manager. Keep in mind that we support Linux so the tests need to also pass on linux.
