## Contributing Guide

Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/x-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-exercise-data)

## Swift Track

We use Travis CI to automatically run all the unit tests on the code that is going to be checked in. In addition we also have [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) set up to make sure that the code is consistent across all exercises. Please run `swiftlint autocorrect --format` on your code before submitting a PR. Also in order for the tests to run they need to be added to the `xcodeProject` project. Make sure all the tests pass locally and that you are using the latest Xcode version otherwise the Travis checks may fail.
