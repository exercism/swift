# Introduction

Within the body of a function, parameters are treated as constants, not variables; trying to modify the value of a parameter will raise a compile-time error. If a function wishes to modify the value of a parameter, it must use an _in-out parameter_ to make this mutability explicit.

To use in-out parameters, a programmer must be sure of three things:

1. The function definition must explicitly mark in-out parameters by writing the keyword `inout` between the `:` and the type name in the parameter's type annotation.
2. The value passed in to the in-out parameter must be declared as a variable, not a constant. Similarly it cannot be a literal.
3. The variable name must be preceded by an `&` in the call to the function, explicitly marking it as modifiable.

When this is done, the function will make an internal copy of the in-out parameter, modify it as directed in the body of the function and then copy the modified value back into the variable that was passed in when the function returns.

```swift
func updateVersion(_ record: inout (version: Int, title: String)) {
  record.version += 1
}

var dbRecord = (version: 2, title: "Exercism")
updateVersion(&dbRecord)

// dbRecord is now (3, "Exercism")
```
