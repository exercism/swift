# Introduction

Swift is a type-safe, statically typed language, which means that the types of all values are known at compile time and that one type cannot be used in your program where a different type is expected. The type associated with a variable can be either explicitly specified, or it can be inferred by the compiler based on the assigned value. Therefore, the following two variable definitions are equivalent:

```swift
var explicitVar: Int = 10 // Explicitly typed
var implicitVar = 10 // Implicitly typed
```
