# Introduction

Swift is a statically-typed language, which means that every value has a known, fixed type at compile time.

Swift has values of a number of fundamental data types that are similar to what is seen in other programming languages, including integers, booleans, and floating point numbers. In addition to these types, Swift also offers a number of more complex types that values can be, including arrays, dictionaries, and functions.

Swift supports two types of comments. Single line comments start with `//` and continue to the following newline. Multiline comments are inserted between `/*` and `*/`.
