### Breaking strings apart

In addition to building up strings out of components, strings may also be taken apart and broken into individual components. This is useful for tasks such as breaking apart a list of comma separated values into an array of the individual entities. Note that not all of these functions are in Swift's standard library and will require the importing of additional libraries. The most commonly used library is `Foundation`.

Importing modules is done by writing the `import` keyword followed by the name of the module. This allows access to all of the types, values, and functionality inside that module; in this example we are making use of the `components(separatedBy:)` method which becomes available to `String` with this import.

```swift
import Foundation

let csv = "apple,pear,peach,orange,cherry,lime,goosberry"
let fruit = csv.components(separatedBy: ",")
// => ["apple", "pear", "peach", "orange", "cherry", "lime", "goosberry"]
```
