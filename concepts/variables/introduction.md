# Introduction

Values can be associated with names by defining a variable and assigning a value to that variable. That name may then be used to refer to that value throughout the program. As the name implies, a variable is _mutable_, which means that the value can be changed at any time.

Variables are defined using the `var` keyword

```swift
var variableName = 10
```

Updating a variable's value is done using the `=` operator.

```swift
variableName = 13 // update to new value
```
