# Introduction

Swift has a set of statements that can be used to alter the normal control flow of loops.
These are known as control transfer statements.
You have already seen `return`; this concept will introduce other, which include `continue`, `break`, and labels.
We won't cover `fallthrough` in this concept, but you can read about it in the [Swift book][fallthrough].

## Continue

Sometimes it is necessary to skip to the next iteration of a loop early, without completing the rest of the statements in the current iteration of the loop.
The `continue` keyword can be used for this.
When `continue` is executed, the loop jumps to the next check to see if the next iteration of the loop can be run, i.e. the `while` in while and repeat-while loops or the check if there's another element in the sequence in for-in loops.

```swift
count = 1
while count < 6 {
  count += 1
  if count == 4 { continue }
  print(count)
}

// prints:
// 2
// 3
// 5
```

## Break

Break is used to exit a loop early.
When `break` is executed, the loop will immediately exit and the program will continue with the first statement after the loop.

```swift
for fruit in ["banana", "grapes", "apple", "strawberry", "kiwi", "lemon"] {
  if !fruit.count.isMultiple(of: 2) { break }
  print(fruit)
}

// prints:
// banana
// grapes
```

## Labels

When loops are nested, there are times when one may want to use `break` or `continue` to exit or restart the outer loops that contain the loop in which the `break` or `continue` are used.
In cases like these, labels may be used to specify the loop to be exited or restarted.
A loop can be labeled by putting a name followed by a colon before the `while`, `repeat`, or `for` that starts the loop.

To see the effect of using labels in this way, consider the following loop.

```swift
outerLoop: for fruit in ["banana", "grapes", "apple", "strawberry", "kiwi", "lemon"] {
  print("\n--- \(fruit) ---")
  for letter in fruit {
    guard letter != "n" else { break outerLoop }
    print(letter)
  }
}

// prints:
// --- banana ---
// b
// a
```
