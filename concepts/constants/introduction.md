# Introduction

Values can be associated with names by defining a constant and assigning a value to the constant. That name may then be used to refer to that value throughout the program. As the name implies, a constant is _immutable_ which means that the value cannot be changed.

Constants are defined using the `let` keyword.

```swift
let constantName = 10 // constant
```
