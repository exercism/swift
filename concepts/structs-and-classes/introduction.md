# Introduction

[Structs and classes][structs-and-classes] are two of the primary building blocks of Swift programming. They are both means of grouping together related data and functions into self-contained units of functionality. All of the basic types that you have been working with up to this point, such as `Int`, `Double`, and `Character` as well as collection types like `Array`, `String`, and `Dictionary` are actually structs. And when you define a struct or class, you are defining a new type to be used within Swift, just as you used those types.
