# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

## Setup

Go through the project setup instructions for Xcode using Swift:

Notably, from the source directory:

`swift test` runs tests  
`swift package generate-xcodeproj` creates an Xcode project
