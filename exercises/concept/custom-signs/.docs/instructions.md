# Instructions

In this exercise you'll be writing code to help a sign company create custom messages for their signs.

## 1. Create a set of useful strings

Define the following constant strings which will be used to create signs:

- `birthday`: This holds the value "Birthday"
- `valentine`: This holds the value "Valentine's Day"
- `anniversary`: This holds the string "Anniversary"

## 2. Create a set of useful characters

Define the following constant characters which will be used to create signs:

- `space`: This holds the value " " (a single space)
- `exclamation`: This holds the value "!"

## 3. Combine phrases to build up messages

Implement the function `buildSign(for:name:)`, which takes the argument `for` which holds one of the three strings you defined in the first task and the argument `name` which is a string that holds the name of the person the sign is for.
You shall use concatenation to build up the message for the sign and remember to reuse the already defined constants.
The function should return the sign message as a string.

```swift
buildSign(for: birthday, name: "Otto")
// returns "Happy Birthday Otto!"

buildSign(for: anniversary, name: "Valentina")
// returns "Happy Anniversary Valentina!"
```

## 4. Build a graduation sign

Implement the function `graduationFor(name:year:)` which takes the argument `name` which is a string that holds the name of the person the sign is for and the argument `year` which is an integer that holds the year the person is graduating.
You shall use template strings to build up the message for the sign.
The function should return the sign message as a string.

```swift
graduationFor(name: "Padma", year: 2023)
// returns "Congratulations Padma!\nClass of 2023"
```

## 5. Compute the cost of a sign

Implement the function `costOf(sign:)` which takes the argument `sign` which is a string that holds the message for the sign.
The sign has a base price of 20 in the given currency. Additionally each letter costs 2 (Whitespaces are included in the calculation).
The function should return the cost of the sign as an integer.

```swift
costOf(sign: "Happy Birthday Grandma!")
// returns 66
```
