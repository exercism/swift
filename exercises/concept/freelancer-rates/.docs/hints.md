# Hints

## General

- Use various [Arithmetic Operators][arithmeticoperators] to preform mathematical operations.
- Browse the [`Int`][int] and [`Double`][double] documentation to learn about functions and operators that work with `Int`s and `Double`s.

## 1. Calculate the daily rate given an hourly rate

- You will need to explicitly convert between `Int` and `Double`.

## 2. Calculate the monthly rate, given an hourly rate and a discount

- There is a [method available][rounded] for rounding `Double`s.

## 3. Calculate the number of workdays given a budget, hourly rate and discount

- There is a [method available][rounded] for rounding `Double`s where you can supply the rounding rule to use.
