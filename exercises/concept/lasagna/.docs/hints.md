# Hints

## General

- An [integer value][integer-value] can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.

## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to [define a constant][constant].

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to [define a function][function] with a single parameter.
- You can use and refer to the previously defined constant by its name.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for subtraction][arithmetical-operators] to subtract values.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to [define a function][function] with a single parameter.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for multiplication][arithmetical-operators] to multiply values.

## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

- You need to define [a function with two parameters][multiple-parameters].
- You can [call one of the other functions][function] you've defined previously.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for addition][arithmetical-operators] to add values.
