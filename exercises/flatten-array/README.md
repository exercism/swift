# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

## Setup

Go through the project setup instructions for Xcode using Swift:

http://exercism.io/languages/swift  
http://exercism.io/languages/swift/tests

Notably, from the source directory:

`swift test` runs tests  
`swift package generate-xcodeproj` creates an Xcode project
