The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function which takes a name, say Alice, and returns the string with the given name, in this case "Hello, Alice!". If no name is passed in, then the function returns the string "Hello, World!". The function should be named `hello`.
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.
